#Pedometer for STM32F4
##Use the MEMS accelerometer to count number of steps

This project is part of a collaborative project whose purpose is to develop a simple yet realistic training support system.
The goal of this project is to develop a pedometer using the MEMS motion sensor on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board.
The device provides the user with statistics about its training activity.
